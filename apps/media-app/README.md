# Swordthain Media App

Private, invite-only photo/video sharing for a closed group of friends. Serves `swordthain.com`.

React + Vite SPA with two views sharing one app shell, branched on the signed-in user's Cognito group: the **admin UI** (Owner) — folder management, the permissions matrix, friend invites, storage/security stats, and a lightbox/player for viewing + downloading media — and a **friend view** (Member) — the same folder browser and lightbox/player, plus a Playlists tab, minus anything mutating (no add/rename/delete folder). The friend view doesn't add any new components for folder browsing; it reuses `FolderBrowser` with an `isOwner={false}` prop that hides the owner-only controls. Server-side authorization (`resolveAccess`, `MediaAccessFn`) was already correct for Members since Phase 3/5 — this was purely a client-side gating change.

## Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript, built with Vite. No router library — five views, plain `useState` navigation is simpler than adding a dependency for it.
- Auth: Cognito's passwordless custom-auth flow, called directly from the browser via `@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider` (`InitiateAuth` / `RespondToAuthChallenge` / refresh). No password, no Amplify — same flow the backend's Lambda triggers implement (see `infra/lib/auth-stack.ts`).
- Talks directly to the deployed HTTP API (`infra/lib/media-app-data-stack.ts`) — no server component of its own. That API and everything behind it runs in **eu-west-1**, not us-east-1 — see `infra/README.md`'s "Region split" section.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# http://localhost:5173
```

`.env` has the real, non-secret config (Cognito client ID, API URL, region) — these are meant to ship in the client bundle, so it's committed rather than gitignored. `localhost:5173` is already an allowed CORS origin on the API (see `MediaAppDataStack`'s `allowedOrigins`). `VITE_AWS_REGION` is `us-east-1` (that's Cognito's region — unaffected by the region migration); `VITE_API_URL` points at the eu-west-1 HTTP API.

**There's also a gitignored `.env.local`, which Vite loads with *higher* priority than `.env`.** If it exists and disagrees with `.env`, its values win silently — including in `npm run build`, not just `npm run dev`. This caused a real, confusing failure during the region migration: `.env` was updated to the new API URL, but a stale `.env.local` from earlier local dev still had the old one, so the production build kept calling the decommissioned API. Vite's output hash didn't change between builds (same env value in, same bundle out) and the browser only ever reported a generic "Failed to fetch" — worth checking `.env.local` is either absent or in sync with `.env` if a rebuild ever behaves unexpectedly.

Sign in with any Cognito user's email. `Owner` accounts land in the admin UI; `Member` accounts land in the friend view. The client-side branch (`isOwner()` in `auth.ts`, decoding the ID token's `cognito:groups` claim) is a UI convenience only — every Owner-only endpoint enforces it server-side regardless, and every Member-visible endpoint is gated by `resolveAccess` walking the folder-share tree, so a Member can never see or act on a folder that isn't explicitly shared with them (or a descendant of one that is) no matter what the client renders.

Signing in also writes a copy of the ID token to a `swordthain_session` cookie scoped to `.swordthain.com` (see `setSessionCookie` in `auth.ts`). This exists solely so `labs.swordthain.com` (playground, see `infra/lib/playground-stack.ts`) can tell at the edge whether *someone* is signed in before deciding whether to serve real content or a static 404 — it's a stealth/obscurity layer, not a security boundary, and isn't read by anything in this app itself. It's a no-op outside `*.swordthain.com` hostnames (e.g. local dev on `localhost`).

## Production hosting & deploys

Served from a private S3 bucket (`SiteBucket`, `infra/lib/media-app-data-stack.ts`, eu-west-1) behind CloudFront (`SiteDistribution` + a CloudFront-scope WAF, `infra/lib/media-app-hosting-stack.ts`, us-east-1 — CloudFront/ACM/WAFv2-for-CloudFront can only be managed from there, see `infra/README.md`'s "Region split" section). A push to `main` touching `apps/media-app/**` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`'s `deploy-media-app` job: `npm ci && npm run build`, sync `dist/` to the bucket (`--region eu-west-1`, since the job's default region is us-east-1), invalidate the distribution — via a GitHub Actions OIDC role (`swordthain-media-app-ci`, `infra/lib/ci-stack.ts`) scoped to just that bucket and distribution, no static AWS keys involved. (`deploy.yml` also covers `infra/**` via a sibling `deploy-infra` job in the same workflow, merged 24 Aug 2026 so a push touching both areas gets exactly one downstream test run instead of two racing ones — see `infra/README.md`.) Serves `swordthain.com`/`www.swordthain.com` directly — the DNS cutover from playground's old distribution is done (see `infra/README.md`'s `SwordthainMediaAppHostingStack` section for how).

## Pages

Owner sees all six tabs below. Member sees Folders and Playlists only, with no "Add folder"/Rename/Delete controls within Folders.

- **Folders** — browse (breadcrumb navigation, nested), create, rename, move (reparent anywhere in the tree — rejects moving a folder into itself or one of its own descendants), delete (blocked with a 409 if the folder still has sub-folders or media — has to be emptied first). Members get a read-only version: browse only, folders outside what's shared with them (directly or via an ancestor) simply don't appear. Moving a folder changes what *inherited* access resolves to for Members relying on an ancestor's share rather than an explicit share on that exact folder — explicit shares on the moved folder/its descendants are unaffected.
- Individual photos/videos can be **deleted** (Owner-only, removes both the S3 original and thumbnail plus the DB row) singly, or via a **select-and-bulk-delete** flow for photos specifically. Any item can also have a short **description** (Owner-only, 140 chars) that displays instead of its filename everywhere it's shown to viewers (grid caption, Lightbox, playlist item list, playlist player) — the Activity log, CSV export, and downloaded file's name always keep the real filename.
- **Playlists** — private, video-only queues (`Playlists.tsx`/`PlaylistPlayer.tsx`). Both Owner and Members can create playlists and add videos from any folder they have access to, then play them back to back. Playback reuses the `view-url` endpoint unchanged and never calls `download-url`, so the feature adds no new download surface. The Owner can browse any Member's playlist contents, matching the folders convention elsewhere in this app.
- **Permissions** — the friends × folders grid from the spec. Each cell is a `none / view / download / upload` select; changing it calls the grant/revoke share endpoint directly.
- **Friends** — invite form (email + optional immediate folder access + personal note) and the current friend list. SES production access is enabled, so real invite emails deliver.
- Within Folders, clicking a thumbnail opens a **lightbox** — an `<img>` for photos, a native `<video controls>` player for videos (progressive streaming via a presigned URL; see `infra/README.md` for why this isn't adaptive HLS yet). A separate **Download** action fetches a short-lived download URL and triggers a browser download. Both call the backend's `resolveAccess`-gated `view-url`/`download-url` endpoints and get logged to `ActivityLog`, and both work identically for Members with `view`/`download` permission on the folder.
- **Activity** — filter by folder and/or friend (at least one required — matches the backend's two GSIs), see a table of who viewed/downloaded what and when, export the current view as CSV. Folder/friend options come from the same `permissionsMatrix()` call the Permissions and Friends tabs already use. Owner-only.
- **Storage** — S3 storage-class breakdown, DynamoDB item counts, Lambda error rates, WAF/API Gateway metrics, and SES sending status (`Storage.tsx`, backed by `stats.ts`). Owner-only.

## A bug this caught

Building and testing this UI against the *real* deployed API (not hand-crafted Lambda test events) surfaced a real authorization bug: API Gateway's HTTP API JWT authorizer serializes the `cognito:groups` claim as a bracket-wrapped string (`"[Owner]"`), not a JSON array — despite the `@types/aws-lambda` types allowing `string[]` and despite an earlier hand-crafted test (using a real array) appearing to "confirm" array behavior. Every Owner-only endpoint was silently 403'ing for real requests until this was fixed in `infra/lambda/media/authz.ts`. Worth remembering: a claims-parsing assumption isn't verified until it's been exercised through the actual authorizer, not a synthetic test payload.
