# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repo structure

This is a monorepo with two independent apps under `apps/`:

- `apps/playground/` — the original swordthain.com app (a directory of company demo sites). Its own `CLAUDE.md` has full details. Now hosted at `labs.swordthain.com`, gated to the owner only.
- `apps/media-app/` — the private, invite-only media-sharing app for friends, serving the root `swordthain.com` domain. React + Vite admin UI plus a friend-facing view — see its `README.md`. Talks to the backend in `infra/`; has no server component of its own.
- `infra/` — shared AWS CDK (TypeScript) app, deployed. Five stacks: `SwordthainAuthStack` (Cognito), `SwordthainMediaAppDataStack` (media-app's S3/DynamoDB/API/Lambda backend, eu-west-1), `SwordthainMediaAppHostingStack` (media-app's CloudFront/WAF hosting, us-east-1), `SwordthainPlaygroundStack` (playground's `labs.swordthain.com` hosting + API auth), `SwordthainCiStack` (GitHub OIDC deploy roles). See `infra/README.md` for what each contains.

Read the relevant app's docs before working inside it — conventions, deploy commands, and architecture are documented per-app, not here.

## Shared infra

Both apps share the same AWS account and some resources at the account level:
- Route 53 hosted zone: `swordthain.com` (zone ID `Z09793352H82VF3C9TII2`)
- ACM certificate(s) for the domain and its subdomains
- A CloudFront WAF Web ACL
- Cognito User Pool (`infra/lib/auth-stack.ts`) — Owner/Member groups, shared by both apps' auth

Each app deploys its own CDK stack independently; shared resources in `infra/` are provisioned separately so they don't couple the two apps' deploys together.

## Automated regression tests run after every deploy

`infra/regression-tests` signs in as a dedicated, Owner-privileged test account (fixed OTP, zero human interaction — see its README for how) and exercises real CRUD flows against the live `apps/media-app` API, cleaning up everything it creates inside one "CI Test" folder. `.github/workflows/regression-test.yml` runs it automatically after `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` succeeds. Run it yourself after any change — `npm test` in that directory, no OTP needed — and add or extend a scenario in `src/scenarios/` for whatever the change was, so it stays covered going forward. It doesn't cover `apps/playground`/`labs.swordthain.com` or anything only a real browser would catch (e.g. a CSP misconfiguration) — the manual checks below still matter for those.

`infra/a11y-tests` runs alongside it (same trigger, same fixed-OTP account, separate CI role/concurrency group) — Playwright + axe-core scanning every `apps/media-app` tab and several interactive states for WCAG 2.1 AA violations, plus an explicit keyboard check that the Lightbox/PlaylistPlayer focus trap actually holds. `npm test` in that directory (or `SWORDTHAIN_A11Y_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npm test` against a local dev server while iterating). Also doesn't cover `apps/playground` yet.

## Verify everything after any deployment

Both apps share the same account-level resources (Cognito pool, the cross-subdomain `swordthain_session` cookie, Route 53, CloudFront), so a change to one can silently break the other. After deploying anything — even a change that looks scoped to one app — re-check end to end rather than just the piece that changed:

- `swordthain.com` — sign in and confirm the app itself works, not just that the page loads.
- `labs.swordthain.com` — confirm it loads for a signed-in Owner. Its stealth gate depends on that same shared session cookie, so signing out of `swordthain.com` (e.g. after test cleanup) also locks you out here — a 404 here doesn't necessarily mean something broke, check the session first.
- playground's create → open → delete cycle — a demo site can have a valid `sites.json` catalog entry with no real content behind it (this happened for real: two entries sat in the catalog for a while with no S3 object ever uploaded, 403ing the moment anyone opened them). Loading the directory page proves nothing about whether *creating* a site actually produces a working one. Create a throwaway test company, open it to confirm real content rendered, then delete it via the `/archive` API's `{action:"delete"}` (not just the UI's "Archive" button, which only hides it) so no test data is left behind.

## A recurring gotcha worth knowing before touching auth code

API Gateway's HTTP API JWT authorizer serializes Cognito's `cognito:groups` claim as a bracket-wrapped **string** (`"[Owner]"`), not a real array — despite `@types/aws-lambda` allowing `string[]` for that field. This bit us once already (see `infra/lambda/media/authz.ts`'s comment and `apps/media-app/README.md`): a hand-crafted Lambda test event using a real array "confirmed" the wrong assumption, and every Owner-only endpoint silently 403'd for real requests until it was caught by testing against the actual deployed API. Don't trust a claims-parsing assumption that's only been tested via a synthetic invoke payload — verify it through the real authorizer.

## After every change — check documentation stays in sync

Docs have gone stale within the same session that produced a feature more than once. Before considering any change done, check whether it needs updates to:

- The relevant app's `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`BACKLOG.md` (features, routes, gotchas — whatever actually changed).
- The **"Swordthain Backlog" Apple Note** — a synced summary of `apps/media-app/BACKLOG.md` and `apps/playground/BACKLOG.md`. Update it alongside those files, not separately, so it doesn't drift from them.
- `infra/docs/architecture-diagram.html` and its duplicate, the `DIAGRAMS` const in `apps/media-app/src/components/Architecture.tsx` — the two are kept in sync with each other. Needs an update if the change adds/removes a route, Lambda, table, GSI, or stack.
- `infra/regression-tests/src/scenarios/` — a new or changed feature usually wants a new scenario or an extension of an existing one, so the automated suite actually covers it going forward instead of just today's manual verification.
- `infra/a11y-tests/tests/` — a new page/tab/view, or a change to an existing one's markup, usually wants a new spec or an extension of an existing one, same reasoning as the regression-test bullet above but for accessibility regressions.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (root) — when a chunk of shipped work is done (the same moment a `BACKLOG.md` "Recently shipped" entry would get added), add a dated entry there too and tag it: `git tag -a vYYYY.MM.DD -m "..."` (bump to `.2`/`.3` etc. if more than one release lands the same day), `git push --tags`, and optionally `gh release create` to match. See `CHANGELOG.md`'s own header for how the history back to Feb 2026 was reconstructed retroactively.

Not every change needs all of these — a CSS tweak needs none of them, a new API route needs at least the relevant README and probably the architecture diagram. Use judgment, but *check* rather than assume no doc changes are needed.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
